**Company** : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**Name** : Khambhayta Nikhil Pravinbhai

**Intern ID** : CT08VDB

**Domain** : ANDROID DEVELOPMENT

**Duration** : 4 WEEKS

**Mentor** : NEELA SANTOSH

## **Project Overview**

- As part of my **Android Development Internship** at **CodTech IT Solutions**, I am developing a **Fitness Tracker App** that monitors users' physical activity, including **step count, distance traveled, and calories burned**.

- This app leverages **Androidâ€™s built-in sensors** for real-time tracking and stores data for historical analysis. It includes **data visualization** using **charts and graphs**, along with a **background service** that records users' daily activity automatically at **11:59 PM**.

- The primary goal of this project is to create an efficient **fitness-tracking** solution that helps users monitor their daily activity and track progress over time.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Real-Time Step Tracking**

      âœ… Uses Androidâ€™s built-in step sensor to track live step count.

      âœ… Updates step count in real-time on the home screen.

2. Distance & Calorie Calculation

      âœ… Calculates distance traveled using step length approximation.

      âœ… Calories burned is estimated based on movement data.

3. Data Visualization (Graph & List Display)

      âœ… Displays daily, weekly, and monthly step count using graphs.

      âœ… List view shows detailed step count, distance, and calories for each day.

4. Background Processing (Auto Save at 11:59 PM)

      âœ… Stores daily activity in Room Database at 11:59 PM using WorkManager.

      âœ… Ensures data is saved even if the app is closed.

6. Historical Data Storage

      âœ… Saves all past step count records for progress tracking.

      âœ… Users can view and compare their performance over time.

## **Technologies & Tools Used**

      ðŸ›  Android Studio â€“ Development environment

      ðŸ›  Java/Kotlin â€“ Primary programming language

      ðŸ›  Android Sensors â€“ Step Counter & Accelerometer

      ðŸ›  LiveData & ViewModel â€“ For real-time UI updates

      ðŸ›  MPAndroidChart Library â€“ For graph-based visualization

      ðŸ›  Sqlite Database â€“ Local storage for step count history

      ðŸ›  WorkManager â€“ Background task scheduler for daily data storage

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**
### **1. Project Setup & Dependencies**

     - Created a new Android Studio project.

     - Integrated Step Counter API and Room Database.
  
### **2. UI Design**
  
    - Designed an interactive UI with:
      
      âœ… Live Step Counter
      
      âœ… Graph View for Visualization
      
      âœ… List View for Daily Tracking
      
      âœ… Settings Page for User Preferences
### **3. Implementing Step Tracking**
  
    - Used SensorManager API to track steps in real-time.
  
    - Displayed step count updates instantly on the home screen.
    
### **4. Distance & Calorie Calculation**
   
    - Applied custom formula to estimate distance and calories burned.

    - Displayed results live on the dashboard.

### **5. Storing Daily Data Automatically**
    
    - Used WorkManager to save step data at 11:59 PM automatically.
    
    - Data is stored in Room Database and retrieved for future use.

### **6. Data Visualization**
    
     - Integrated MPAndroidChart for step count graphs.
     
     - Used ListView/RecyclerView for daily record display.

## **Challenges & Solutions**

  ðŸš§ Step Count Reset on App Restart 
      â€“ Used SharedPreferences to keep track of the last recorded steps.

  ðŸš§ Background Processing Issues 
      â€“ Implemented WorkManager for reliable daily data storage.

  ðŸš§ Battery Optimization Restrictions 
      â€“ Ensured the app works without excessive battery drain.

## **Unique Features & Enhancements**

    âœ” Real-Time Step Tracking â€“ Uses Androidâ€™s built-in step sensor.

    âœ” Daily Data Storage at 11:59 PM â€“ Automatically stores progress.

    âœ” Graph & List View for Insights â€“ Helps users track trends.

    âœ” Low Power Consumption â€“ Optimized for minimal battery usage.

## **Learning Outcomes**

    âœ… Gained hands-on experience with Android Sensors & Step Counting APIs.

    âœ… Learned how to store and retrieve data using Room Database.
    
    âœ… Implemented real-time UI updates using LiveData & ViewModel.

    âœ… Improved background processing skills with WorkManager.

    âœ… Enhanced problem-solving abilities in real-time data tracking.
